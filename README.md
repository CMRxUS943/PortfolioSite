# PortfolioSite
Repo for my portfolio site.


I am creating a portfolio site. I want to create a modern looking site (similar to apple) that has a navbar and a few different pages, as well as a homepage. I would like this site
to be interactive (sliding animations when the user views a page, submenus on the navbar, etc...). Feel free to help me make improvements as a beginnner in webdev!
